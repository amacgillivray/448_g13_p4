# Project 4 - Maintenance Plan 

Maintenance costs will largely revolve around the choice of server provider and the networking efficiency (how many games can be hosted on a single server at once). With a provider like DigitalOcean, the game could probably handle several dozen players at once on a single $5/month droplet. However, scaling that up to handle hundreds or thousands of players would be a new challenge. If this challenge does arise, we were thinking to up the price of our game. If our game becomes that popular among the gaming community then we will start having players pay $10/month. This will also depend on what our vendor thinks how having a large community on our game would affect the performance of the networking solution. As the matchmaking system may become slow due to the influx in players joining our game server. As our vendor who looks over our high-performance network would also need to determine how the advertisements would not slow the game down as well. As advertisements are an essential part of the income we make due to having a low cost game. Developers may also need to be hired to handle browser compatibility issues and the aforementioned anti-cheat system. The developers will have the capability to fix the game if the developers find bugs or errors within our code and developers will be in charge of the cheat system. If a user is caught cheating the developers will ban the user from play for two weeks. The cost for hiring developers will vary because some developers will only be checking for cheaters and errors, while we will have another development team that will discuss with our team the “owners” on addition ideas and things to add to make the game more fun. These developers will be paid a significant amount more than everyone else on our team. As for the cheating developers they will need to find ways to stop hacking or cheating in possibly a way inside the game or maybe we will need to take it up with our vendor that we need a security provider. Our game is more of a Preventive maintenance style as we aim to try and eliminate all problems or defects within the game as they appear over time. As our developers detect this problem they will then update our documentation and provide the exact date and time of the problem they fixed within the game. We hope to have a small and stable development team so we will not need to take the time away from monitoring the game, to explain to the new developer how everything works. We will also include the perfective maintenance style as users request demands we will review them and provide updates with perfection to the users’ request. This will keep the users happy and allow our game to be as efficient as possible with the new updates we provide. We will carefully review our updates and test the game ourselves to make sure that the updates do not have any defects, or errors within the gameplay.
